üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python (with Flask or similar framework for API endpoints)

Frontend:

->HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface

->Bootstrap for responsive layout and styling

->jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests

->Chart.js for data visualization (protocol, packet size, and energy charts)

->Optional Remote Access: ngrok for exposing your local server to the internet

Note:
This project currently uses a traditional web stack (HTML/CSS/JS) for the dashboard. React is not used, but you can migrate or add a React frontend in the future if you prefer a modern SPA (Single Page Application) approach
